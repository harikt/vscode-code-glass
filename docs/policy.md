# CodeGlass Development Policy

This document outlines the development policies and guidelines for the CodeGlass project. It serves as a guide for all contributors and maintainers to ensure consistent and efficient development practices.

## 1. Development Principles

- **User-Centric Design**: Always prioritize the end-user experience in all design and implementation decisions.
- **Modularity**: Develop features as modular components to enhance maintainability and extensibility.
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency, especially considering the real-time nature of code analysis.
- **Security**: Ensure the security of user code and data at all times.
- **Open Source**: Embrace open-source principles and foster a collaborative development environment.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Primary Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js
- **VS Code API**: Utilize the latest stable VS Code Extension API
- **AI Model**: Initially use Ollama's code-specific model, with flexibility to switch or incorporate other models in the future

## 3. Development Workflow

1. **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues for task management and bug tracking.
2. **Branching Strategy**:
    - `main` branch for stable releases
    - `develop` branch for ongoing development
    - Feature branches for individual features or bug fixes
3. **Pull Requests**: All changes must be submitted via pull requests and reviewed by at least one other contributor.
4. **Continuous Integration**: Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## 4. Coding Standards

- Follow the [TypeScript Style Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear, concise comments and documentation
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for core functionality

## 5. Version Control

- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Maintain a clear and detailed CHANGELOG.md

## 6. Documentation

- Keep `README.md` up-to-date with the latest project information
- Maintain comprehensive API documentation
- Document all major design decisions and architectural changes

## 7. Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Perform integration testing for VS Code extension compatibility
- Conduct user acceptance testing before major releases

## 8. Performance and Optimization

- Regularly profile the extension for performance bottlenecks
- Optimize AI model integration for quick response times
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## 9. AI Integration Policy

- Ensure transparency about AI-generated content
- Provide users with control over AI feature usage
- Regularly update and fine-tune AI models for accuracy and relevance

## 10. Community Engagement

- Respond to issues and pull requests in a timely manner
- Encourage and credit community contributions
- Regularly seek feedback from users and incorporate it into development plans

## 11. Release Cycle

- Aim for regular release cycles (e.g., monthly for minor updates)
- Conduct thorough testing and code reviews before each release
- Maintain a public roadmap of planned features and improvements

## 12. Ethical Considerations

- Respect user privacy and data protection regulations
- Avoid bias in AI-generated comments and suggestions
- Consider the environmental impact of AI model usage and optimize accordingly

This policy is subject to change as the project evolves. All major policy changes will be discussed with the community before implementation.
